// 1. JS runtime environment contains all elements required to run JS.
// 2. It contains JS engine, set of API's, callback queue, microtask queue, event loop.
// 3. JS engine is a piece of code.
// 4. Process includes Parsing ---> Compilation -----> Execution.
// 5. Parsing breaks code into tokens and converts it into AST(Abstract Syntax Tree).
// 6. Modern JS engine follows JIT compilation, it interprets while it optimises code as much as it can.
// 7. Execution and Compilation are done together.
// 8. Execution has Garbage collector and other optimisation such as inlining, copy elusion, inline caching etc.
